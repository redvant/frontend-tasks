Create a react app.
This app should display (at least) a list of all bootcampers
Every bootcamper could be some kind of card or something like that (BE CREATIVE)
There's no need to use events
There's no need to use state
Please make use of props 
Please use pure CSS to style your components. The use of Flexbox and Grid is a plus
