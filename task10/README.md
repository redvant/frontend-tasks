Create a coomponent that will display and array of "something"
"Something" can be whatever you want! animals, students, cakes, etc. But the object should have AT LEAST 2 properties... a "description" and a "value" for example.
That array should get populated  simulating a call to an API. The "API call" should take 3 seconds.
Style the component as much as you want using flexbox and/or grid (extra points)
